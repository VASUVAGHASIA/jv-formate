## 📏 Typography Hierarchy (Exact Sizes)

```
DOCUMENT TITLE
├─ 20pt, Bold, Centered
└─ Example: "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare"

├─ Space Before: 12pt, After: 6pt
└─ Use for: Introduction, Methodology, Results, Conclusion

## HEADING 2 (Sub-sections)
├─ 14pt, Bold, Left-aligned
├─ Space Before: 10pt, After: 6pt

## 🧠 Smart Content Structuring

### When to Use PARAGRAPHS (Justified/Left)

✅ **Use paragraphs for**:
- Explanations and analysis
- Narrative and storytelling
- Arguments and reasoning
- Background and context
- Conclusions (narrative style)
- Legal/academic content

**Example**:
> Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in modern healthcare, revolutionizing diagnostics and treatment planning. The global AI healthcare market reached $19.8 billion in 2024, with projections indicating growth to $187.95 billion by 2030.

---

### When to Use BULLET POINTS (Left-aligned)

✅ **Use bullets for**:
- Lists of items or features
- Key takeaways and highlights
- Benefits and advantages
- Requirements and specifications
- Action items (non-sequential)

**Example**:
> Key Benefits:
> • **Improved Accuracy**: 40-60% reduction in diagnostic errors
> • **Faster Processing**: Analysis time from hours to minutes
> • **Cost Efficiency**: 30-50% operational savings
> • **24/7 Availability**: Continuous monitoring capability

---

### When to Use NUMBERED LISTS

✅ **Use numbered lists for**:
- Sequential steps or procedures
- Ranked items (priority order)
- Chronological events
- Legal/formal sections

**Example**:
> Installation Steps:
> 1. Download the installer
> 2. Run setup.exe as administrator
> 3. Follow the on-screen instructions
> 4. Restart your computer

---

### When to Use TABLES

✅ **Use tables for**:
- Comparing 2+ options
- Data presentation (statistics, metrics)
- Specifications and parameters
- Schedules and timelines
- Pros & cons side-by-side

**Example**:
```markdown
| Feature | Basic | Pro | Enterprise |
|---------|-------|-----|------------|
| Storage | 10GB  | 100GB | Unlimited |
| Price   | $9    | $29 | $99        |
| Support | Email | 24/7 | Dedicated  |
```

## 📐 Alignment Rules

### Justified Alignment (Professional)
✅ Use for:
- Technical reports (formal)
- Research papers
- Legal documents
- Business proposals (body text)
- Academic essays

**Why**: Professional, publication-quality appearance

---

### Left Alignment (Standard)
✅ Use for:
- Casual documents
- Newsletters
- Emails and memos
- Bullet point lists (always!)
- Headings (always!)
- Modern business docs

**Why**: Easier to read, modern look

---

### Center Alignment (Minimal Use)
✅ Use ONLY for:
- Document title (main title only)
- Cover page elements
- Standalone quotes/callouts

❌ NEVER center:
- Regular paragraphs
- Headings (except title)
- Body text

---

## 🚀 AI Decision Making

The AI now automatically decides:

1. **Document Type Detection**
   - "Write a report" → Technical report format (Georgia, justified, 1.5 spacing)
   - "Business proposal" → Corporate format (Calibri, moderate margins)
   - "Legal document" → Legal format (Times New Roman, double-spaced)

2. **Content Structure**
   - Explanatory content → Paragraphs (justified for formal)
   - List of items → Bullet points (left-aligned)
   - Sequential steps → Numbered list
   - Comparing options → Table

3. **Typography Application**
   - Main topic → # Heading 1 (16pt)
   - Sub-topic → ## Heading 2 (14pt)
   - Detail → ### Heading 3 (12pt)
   - Discussion → Body paragraph (11pt, justified)
   - Key terms → **Bold** (same size, strategic)

4. **Spacing & Layout**
   - Formal document → Justify alignment, 1.5 line spacing
   - Standard document → Left alignment, 1.15 line spacing
   - Academic → Left alignment, 2.0 line spacing
   - After headings → 6pt space
   - Between sections → 10-12pt space
